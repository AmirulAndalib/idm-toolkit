# Updates for New Versions
I will check IDM for updates about every month and will update the patch and post it here.

I am also working for a version with one toolkit for all versions


# Features
- **Activate + Patch Latest Version** - Activates the Key and Patches the IDMan.exe to remove key is not genuine error
- **Reset Trial + Remove Activation Info** - Removes ALL activation information and Resets your 30 day IDM trial if you are using a trial *THIS WILL NOT REMOVE THE PATCH! TO REMOVE IT, REINSTALL IDM*
- **Just Activate, dont patch** - You will get the error telling that the key is not genuine
- **Install IDM** - Just installs the latest version which is bundled in the build in the "recources" folder
- **Exit** - Closes the window
